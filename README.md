# Dockerizing-a-Python-Application
This is the Github repository for my blog post on "Dockerizing a Python Application", which is published on Medium. In this post, I'll provide a step-by-step guide on how to containerize a Python application using Docker.

## Introduction
Docker is a powerful tool for developers that allows them to package their applications and all its dependencies into a single portable image. By using Docker, developers can ensure their application runs consistently across different environments and simplifies the deployment process.

In this blog post, you'll learn how to write a Dockerfile, which is a script that specifies the instructions for building a Docker image. You'll also learn how to build the Docker image and run it as a container. Additionally, I will explain how to use Docker Compose, which is a tool that simplifies the management of multiple Docker containers.

## Getting Started
To follow along with this tutorial, you'll need a basic understanding of Python and Docker. You'll also need to have Docker installed on your local machine.
